## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant and warm orange (#FF8C00) to evoke feelings of energy and appetite, appropriate for a grocery store. The choice of orange will also resonate well within the Sri Lankan cultural context.
- Background color: A light, desaturated orange (#FAEBD7) creates a welcoming and soft backdrop without overwhelming the user interface.
- Accent color: A reddish-orange (#E25822), slightly desaturated, to give contrast for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet approachable feel, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, clear icons for product categories and actions, enhancing usability. Consider using a consistent style, such as outline icons.
- A clean, mobile-responsive layout optimized for quick transactions. Prioritize key functions (sales processing, product search) on the main screen.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions, like adding products or completing a sale, without being distracting.
